    Social science researchers at Harvard recently migrated from IQSS’s Research Computing Environment (RCE) to the more powerful FAS Research Computing infrastructure (FASRC). As a result, 3.5 times as many researchers now use cluster resources, CPU usage increased twenty-twofold, and GPU usage exceeds 178,000 hours. Researchers can now undertake larger experiments and more ambitious computational projects, and their use of these resources is expected to grow.
