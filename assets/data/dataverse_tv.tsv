Jane Fry, Chantal Ripp, Meghan Goodchild	Dataverse in Canada Series: Introduction and features you didn't know you needed!	Scholars Portal Dataverse is a publicly accessible, secure, multi-disciplinary, multi-lingual repository for research data, searchable from anywhere in the world, with servers hosted in Canada. This repository platform includes features such as: permanent links (DOIs) that encourage citation of your data set; and allowing you to set licensing terms for access and reuse of your research data.

MingJing Peng et al.	Curation Workflows	In order for data to be more easily discoverable, better understood, and re-usable, it must be âcuratedâ. There are many levels of data curation. The panelists for this session will describe the tools, best practices, and the level of curation performed on datasets in their respective Dataverse repositories.	ILZL_lN7A_g
Ceilyn Boyd et al.	Preservation	The main question of the session is what are the relevant preservation practices designed to ensure data in a Dataverse installation is usable for as long as it needs to be kept within the organizations. The experiences to be presented will explore what best practices exist to manage data preservation and the efforts that have been adopted so far by the Dataverse community for the purpose of archiving content to ensure interoperability, consistency and the safety and security of digital data.

Arfon Smith et al.	Software Metadata and Containerization	Support for computational artifacts such as software, workflows, and containers is needed in the Dataverse software in order to meet the demands of advanced data analysis and enable research reproducibility and reuse. This session will feature invited presentations on software metadata Codemeta, Research Object and RO-Crate metadata, git integration, and adequate documentation and guidelines. We aim to identify practical considerations and implementation steps on the topic for the Dataverse software platform. Following the presentations and Q&A, we will have a discussion on shaping Dataverse software support for Codemeta, RO-Crate, and git integration.	LJq-mzT9v8o
