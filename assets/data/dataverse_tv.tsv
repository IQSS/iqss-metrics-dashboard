Arofan Gregory	WorldFAIR, CDIF, and Cross-Domain FAIR Resources: Dataverse as a FAIRer Repository	This presentation introduces CODATA and the WorldFAIR project and it's goal of helping to define what FAIR implementation means in practical terms, both within and between domains, disciplines, and infrastructures. Repositories play a key role in helping to realize the FAIR vision, but that vision demands that more fine-grained metadata be made available, in a variety of forms. Dataverse is a potential platform for helping data managers meet the increased demands of FAIR, while not placing an unrealistic burden on them. By better supporting standards such as DDI-CDI, SKOS, and others recommended by the WorldFAIR Cross-Domain Interoperability Framework (CDIF), Dataverse could help promote FAIR both within and across domains. This presentation looks at the current state of play for FAIR implementation, and at emerging efforts to enable Dataverse to play this important role.	LA1BbkV3Efk

Stefano Iacus	Bringing Data Close to Compute at Harvard Dataverse	With data becoming increasingly large and machine learning and AI equally popular also outside the hard sciences, we decided to exploit the versatility and cost effectiveness of the MOC infrastructure in terms of high performance computing (NERC) and storage (NESE). Moreover, being MOC an integrated infrastructure, it is possible to run computing on large data without moving data over the Internet.. In this talk we present a proof of concept of this approach where the Dataverse software is integrated with NESE and NERC realizing the goal of computing directly on large data.	9LmiVILZs_Q

This video demostrates the progress so far, especially the ability to display, sort, and filter files on a dataset page."	
Jan Range	pyDataverse-Generator, an automated approach using the OpenAPI specification	PyDataverse is designed to closely resemble Dataverse's native API structure. However, the native API is not static, and new endpoints are added or existing ones can change with each release. This makes it challenging to keep PyDataverse up-to-date with the latest API changes, as there is no active maintenance team. To reduce the maintenance burden and ensure PyDataverse is up to date, OpenAPI specifications can be used to dynamically generate PyDataverse's core. This includes URL endpoints, parameters, payload, and response schemes. In addition, synchronized schemes allow client-side validation of requests that are up-to-date with the current version of Dataverse. Ultimately, automatic synchronization between PyDataverse and Dataverse reduces maintenance burden, allowing the maintenance team to focus on developing a high-level interface for user-friendliness and ensures the core developer team that upstream changes are reflected in client libraries.	
Sonia Barbosa	Intermediate Curation on the Dataverse Platform	This session is designed to delve into the practices, tools, and features of data curation, focusing specifically on the Harvard Dataverse Repository as the platform for storing, sharing, and curating research data.

Dimitri Szabo	Data paper template generation tool	Data papers are small publications allowing to increase the visibility of published dataset, in particular when they are not related to a scientific article. If the description expected in a data paper should be more extensive than the one provided in the repository, most of the information is either the same than the metadata or can be expanded from the metadata a first basis. The concept of this tool is therefore to generate templates of data papers, that can be adapted e.g. for various journals, prefilled from the metadata of datasets published in Dataverse.	
Ramin Soleymani-Fard	IDS Toolkit Demo/Local Contexts - Dataverse	"The RIDAGOP (Indigenous data sovereignty) toolkit (<a href=""https://toolkit.ridagop.net"">https://toolkit.ridagop.net</a>) allows developers to create generic data-management processes, connect them to data-repository systems.

Jan Range	Modular SPA Design: Proof of principle in React	As Dataverse strives towards enriching its capabilities through a single page application, cutting-edge web development libraries like React provide unparalleled flexibility in design. In light of this, a significant achievement would be to enable users to tailor their experience by integrating plugins that extend functionality or streamline data transfer to external applications, such as a review tool.
